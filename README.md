# Todo FE Interview

### Introduction

This is a coding challenge for the ATLAS frontend developer position.

We have a Todo app that has a few errors and poor typescript usage that we want to clean up. The challenge is set up to take up about 30~ minutes of your time and for us to have some code to talk about in the interview.

Please provide your solution back to us 24 hours before the scheduled interview so we have time to review it.

The application is a Todo tracker setup with Next.js page routing and tailwind for CSS.

### Setup

---

First fork this repository so you can commit and share your code back to us.
Then to run the application install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**NOTE: the application often errors, this is intentional**

---

### Issues

- Properly type the return types of our api in `/src/pages/api/todos.ts` and `/src/pages/api/todos/[id].ts` so it does not return a any.
- Remove all any types in `/src/components/TodoList.ts`
- update `/src/components/TodoList.ts` to show a error message when the API returns an error
- Prevent the browser from refreshing when adding a todo in the `/src/components/TodoForm.ts`
  and make sure the todo still gets properly added to the visible todos
- Feel free to refactor any code along the way if you think there could be improvements.

Generally all the relevant code to fix is in the `src/components` folder and the `src/pages/api` folder. You should not need to change any file outside of these four files.

**Good luck!**
